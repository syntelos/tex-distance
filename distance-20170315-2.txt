An ambition of mating or partnering or binding with another is a need to discover another of the kind.  The concepts of spectra, measurement, comparison, and discipline are vital.


The partner measures roughly to your magnitude in available dimensions.  These dimensions have no name and no description.   They are felt more than known.  The truth is a personal mystery that lies within, beyond the resolution of terms.  An enumeration of dimensions would fail due to the complexities with which we partner and mate.  There is no reasonable expectation of objectivity.  However, there is a cause for comparison, relativism, and measure.  


The student of these precepts must consider the measure of another as the objective means of comparison of alternatives.  It is a cold business.  This is the best guidance available.  From some modest distance, the candidate for your admiration may appear to mind in the cold light of weight or measure whereby one sees or understands some internal metaphysical quantities.  The appearance of success and failure are only known subliminally as they rise from the interior to meet the consciousness of intellect.  But they are known, within, and this knowledge is best taken seriously as the only guidance available.
