The world is physical, or metaphysical.  The subjective being, person,
may be trained to either.  The untrained person is subjective, living
immersed in a metaphysical universe.  The technology delivered by our
human ambition populates this universe with the alloys of lead, gold,
copper, tin, mercury, silver, aluminum, lithium, every element known
and many unknown.  Some have power.  Some, voice.  All, breath.

Each person, another world.  Each expression, another language.  Our
babies cry in confusion.  Some adults cry in confusion.  Sometimes a
crying out is necessary.  Most times, it is an question unknown that
none can answer.

When it is healthy, most are content and happy.  When it is unhealthy,
there may be war.  The habit of war is a slavery, as is the habit of
the tolerance of the poverty of education.
