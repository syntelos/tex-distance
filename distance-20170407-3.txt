The individual is primarily subjective, and applies training, skill, and discipline to the realization of objective understanding and comprehension.  The primary example of this process is in the acquisition of mathematics.  Fluency with the languages and tools of mathematics leads to mathematical maturity as the capacity for mathematical thought, understanding, and comprehension.


Similarly, the acquisition of musical training and skill and discipline is a process of developing a capacity for reading and performing and writing music.  It is an entirely distinct mode of thought and expression from the human natural languages of verbal speech.


The history of the sciences shows many rivers of thought flowing into an ocean of mathematics and physics, logic, and the application of these disciplines -- tools -- to human subjectivity.  The independence of these tools from the inert confusion or ignorance that preceded them illustrates the value of these tools.


Today, the metaphysical independence of the individual is relatively unknown.  Our physical independence is circumscribed by our economics, an observation which places us far removed from alternatives to technological sustenance and development.  A metaphysical independence would permit our children knowledge and understanding as would obviate or void “the meaning of life”, dispel “questions regarding sex”, and eliminate “the chaos of politics, law, and war”.


For millennia we have developed the tools for this independence, as recorded to the history of thought.  We have developed languages to facilitate the fairness of occasion in both the physical and metaphysical domains, and are found needing little more than a consolidation of these efforts.
