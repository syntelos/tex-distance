Today I found a juvenile northern brown snake, storeria dekayi, on the
pavement behind AHOPE.  It was very cold.  I picked it up and moved it
to a far superior patch of earth.

Little thing was curled up in a bun with the tip of its tail wrapped
around itself like a ring that captures a whip.  That's how I figured
it was alive and intact.  No visible injuries.  I think it may have
responded to the heat of my hand by letting its head fall into the
depression between two fingers as we walked.

Great story for Saint Patrick's Day.
