I have a rather desperate need to recognize the disservice I do myself by staying in a place that distracts from the necessities I face.  The pursuit if balance has met the imbalance of it.  As anyone, I take the greatest pleasure in knowing the state of my existence.  That I bear the support of my friends and family and country is well known.  That I bear the talents I was born with is obvious.  Therefore it is not solitude that should hinder my advancement.  And it is not age that should enforce my solitude.  While I am of no use to a young woman who seeks a father for her children, this age is immoral to that intent, or so I believe, there may be one for me to share my moments with.  One who understands my expressions and thereby avoids frustration but delivers the pleasures of their sharing.  That I might understand her mind in order to deliver her pleasures of expression, as I have believed in.
