It’s snowing again, today.  Not in flakes, but crunch balls.  Like
micro hale.  Little white snow balls.  They might bounce when they
impact.

Coming down twenty to fourty five degrees above the northern
horizontal.  Pretty.

There’s more likely to be a diesel pickup truck around here.  The
sounds of a highway are always chilling.  Not a place for someone’s
body.  This highway passes through a place not so cold.  Quite warm,
by its own accord.
