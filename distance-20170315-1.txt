In the language of the couple there is substance and separation.  The languages extant over substance and separation have qualities of reciprocity and primacy, indirection and immediacy.  The rôle head exhibits reciprocity to the rôle tail with the satisfaction of need, subject to separation.  As couple separation narrows, rôle differentiation narrows and rôle characterizations diminish.  Reciprocity, indirection, and separation are replaced by primacy, substance, and immediacy.


Condensing the mysteries of the communication of the couple to a paragraph presents a grand challenge to the reader, not unlike learning a skill.  Evolutions through the art develop understanding until textual separation or discord spells relief from the commitment to study. 


The purpose of such a paragraph is to communicate understanding and thereby comprehension.  Alternatively, to issue a warning to others who pass this way.
