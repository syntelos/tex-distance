{\section Anthropolinguistic ideography}

\body

The gracine meets language at tool.  The proposition of language as
tool is not new.  However, awareness is too often inhibited by
insecurity and exploitation.

The horizons opened by language and awareness are physical and
metaphysical, including the physical mortality and metaphysical
society.

An anthropolinguistic ideography in visual language has a literacy of
awareness which begins with the conservation of person.
