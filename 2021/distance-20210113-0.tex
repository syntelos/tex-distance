\input preamble

The legs of performance.
The legs of existence.
The legs of knowing.

And these new legs.  Found in a literature of love and concern
developed from a research soaked in labors of experience and
reflection.

The spiritual, intellectual, social intoxication of it is profound
beyond my depths of reason to challenge awareness.

If you say so.  And you say so.  Then it is distantialism.  And it is
alcoholism.  Then it is love.

It is that miracle of this biological existence that affords our
sustenance as body and mind.  Upon which we reflect in humility to
respect others as self, and earth-society world as mother.
