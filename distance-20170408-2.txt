The metaphysical microcosm, the individual, perceives, experiences, and communicates from consciousness.  We know this conception of the mind as centered in the brain, including the body, and having multiple or parallel centers of cognitive processing.  We can elect to define multiple centers of consciousness contributing to a whole, ψ, as
ψ = α + β + γ + δ + σ
where α is Jung’s inner consciousness we know as the source of emotion, β the outer consciousness we are most familiar with cognitively, γ the social consciousness, δ the sexual consciousness, and σ the esoteric consciousness.


Such models of the metaphysical microcosm serve to frame the complex character of the mind-body identity.  This model proposes a collection of variously independent centers of cognitive processing which interact in a structure which is the foundation of the success of the homo sapien.


The individual experiences each with the skill or naïveté available as self awareness or metaphysical facility.  The naïve juvenile has an immature faculty which develops on the time scale of decades, and in proportion to personal development, into the faculties of the mature adult.
