In this sky a meditation and reflection, an effort of the kind.
Looking, seeming, and being recycled to the study of tools and things,
voices and rings, glyphs falling out and radioactive dust settling,
shelter and refuge and hallowed hall.

A character of being suited to a realm of thought (not of the world).

It is the cause of fidelity, that most characters of being are ill
suited to the world by intent of execution and purpose of competition,
exclusion, extortion.  Are any suited to it, each by its own
respective actuality.  Not likely.  With so many committed to a
reality of mutual exclusion, where fairness is a crime and openness a
sin.

And not of the world, a delegate from that realm (of thought) where
fairness is kind and openness a virtue.
