If we observe our national conflicts as masculine, and literature as feminine -- as projections of ourselves -- would it make a difference?  


What is masculine if not the other of feminine.  In contrast, perhaps, stalwart.  Our asymmetry a burden to that moment of intellect that favors the certitude of rational conclusions.  Is that masculine?


Our words may find the theory of the genetic entity.  It is the biological machine that knows of its reproductive success by body or sharing.  It is burdened by an epistemological duality of knowing.


That intelligence is served well or poorly, and the frustration of its poverty is masculine.  If this is true, is the pleasure of its wealth feminine?


The reflections grow darker under the covers of history, where our asymmetries were manipulated by our behaviors.  


The female body is subject to the penalty of death upon the success of genetic reproduction.  The male body is rewarded by the child in the success of genetic reproduction.


The female raises the child through its immaturity in a partnership with a male, or not.  The male may, or may not, attend to his fruits of his genetic success.
