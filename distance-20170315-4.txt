It takes a lot of time.  We can use the time.  We know the time.


In the time of centuries (of days) we give manifest (birth) to our new self (existence).  It is painful.  We all know of these things, intuitively, making it painful to watch.  


Therefore we give by this documentation.  By this record our divinity might be denoted: elements of thought collapsed to points.  Elements of humanity shared that readers may benefit.


On this road a modus operandi.  The suspension of conclusion for the purpose of research and development.  The production of expression that awaits its recognition.  The language that follows recognition of expression and abstraction of substance.  Ultimately the method of joining, binding, mating, partnering.


The days blur over dimensions of it.  The manifestation of this real and that real.  What is real as the identification of elements of thought, cause and effect.  Not the binding as once discussed, but the binding as once alluded.  Not the reading as could have been marked by knaves and knives, but the reader as praised and honored and valued and so, seated.
