Somewhere within the masculine, under the fear, apart and separate from the need to defend the self, is the divorce of the sex writ on the body as the freedom from the sex.  The body.  The penile thing between the legs that gives cause, that is disposed of as cause of the pain of time and place and role and purpose and intent and meaning.  From here, this spiritual abstraction that divorces the life and the world with it, he wonders if she does the same.  The feminine.  Woman.  Any woman he might be able to imagine, perhaps to meet.  To speak to.  To divorce and free and to live with.  To find peace in the world.  As he finds peace under and outside the world, in that bed where he sleeps.  Without sex.  With love that has no sex.  The love from within where dreams have no care.


A bird sings in the morning of this spilled ink.  I am under the bird in my incomplete wakefulness with Irène beside me, in pages in a book.


I can feel her, like I can feel the cursor slipping and spotting the letters under my fingers on the miracle of technology in my hands.  My mechanical pen.  The one that connects to the waking world of sight and insight where context would place me as a book on a shelf in a library.


Irène remembers her experiences from the unknowable distance to the place she has become.  Desolate, losing, not yet lost.  Finding, as one breathes, another word.
