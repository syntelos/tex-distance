A woman sits nearby who has long dark hair and heavy eyeglasses that
weigh on her features with interest.  Her presence reflects the art of
the pilpul, the debate without conclusion.  The exercise of the art of
the debate and further, the art of the issue.  One could uncover
further reflections from one particular chapter of one particular
book, but I do not.  Rather it is enough to think of her as Rebecca or
Ruth, sitting alone at night with her computer.
