It was empty, her meaning, and in that the grip of death.  Her pages blank, her ink dry.  Absent a spark of appreciation.  


Her name is Irene.  She’s been dead longer than my mother has been alive.  But tonight she is my lover.  Somehow, in the reaches of experience, her absence is mine.  It is not mine, it is like mine, and in this interplay is the subtlety of love making.


Unlike her, I populate her blank pages with the wildlife that escapes the enemy of humanity.  I don’t need to call that a deity.  It is all around me, in me, the breath of life.  But like her, I honor it with an element of smoke that fouls my body and the air but occupies the crack in space that leaves me separate from the life that fills my heart.
