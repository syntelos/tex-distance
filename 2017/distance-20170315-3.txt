With the partner, the communication of the couple transcends
indirection or reciprocity of substance to immediacy or primacy of
substance.  With the partner there exists known (felt) metaphysical
bandwidth or comprehension necessary to coordination and
communication.  With the partner, thoughts of expression “that only
make sense inside my head” will make sense.  With the partner one
takes leave of one’s senses to join the partnership, realizing (the
bandwidth of) immediacy and primacy and substance.
