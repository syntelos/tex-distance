\input preamble

﻿Another number advances my page, my fingers, my lips and my arms.  My eyes water under her.  My arms and hands feel light with her weight.  Irène.  I feel her blank pages and lost books, friends unknown to a heart at sea under the pitch of it, sitting in the comforts of my sheltered life.  A cigarette rolled with tabacco found on the side walks of this modest, heart felt town carved in stone out of mountains lost in time.  To me they are lost in time because I am lost to time.  My age advances with the soil and toil under a celestial heaven known within but to whom other?  A question mark known to me, but to whom other.  A paragraph kept in place for time held too dearly that breath, each, might be appreciated.


With all the daring available I pick up her book, turn its pages in review.  Loosing nothing that I might have read, if possible.  Holding her as a knave holds a word.  Too closely.  Too tightly.  My grip unable to loosen, locked.  I am scared.  Terrified.  Terrified to be lost to loss.  To senselessness without intent of purpose, commitment of love.  


Sleep is a sound cure.  In sleep I find peace where my body escapes time.  I levitate above the din of it, in love and spirit held dear.  My font within.  The source of pleasure and this morning’s inevitable pen.
