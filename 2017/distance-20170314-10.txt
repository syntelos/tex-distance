Sailing the seas of life we take the heart down many roads and
encounter the heart at many turns.  The roads and turns are always
there, the heart is always there, but the knowing of each road and
each turn is not.  Sometimes we find a new road and a new turn and
wonder at the sight of it.  Surprised at the sight of it.  Therefore
we study it.  Is it right and well and good what my imagination shows
me that I will do?  Of course we study it.  

When the heart is well and good of it, and especially when it is of
this well of energy and power, then we know it is well and good.  This
is how we know it is well and good and why fidelity to the breath of
life is important, that we know the heart and we know the heart is
true.
