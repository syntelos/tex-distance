A tall woman with short black hair, bobbed into a ball, walks away
from me towards the door.  I can't imagine the man she's with
comprehends her depths.  At least I imagine depths, there, like the
image of the Mata Hari she envisages.

His problem is that he doesn't look.  He doesn't open his eyes.  The
world of blokes and buds has him surrounded by kettle fish and snare
drums.  He doesn't imagine beyond the far bank of the brook that he's
grown up beside.  He imagines that travelling past the points to which
he has grown roots would render him unrecognizable, and thereby
vulnerable and unable to defend the territory within which he keeps
his family.

My problem is that I miss mine.  Terribly.
