We have established ourselves as homo sapiens.  We have elevated ourselves by language and logic and technology.  We fly in physical and metaphysical space.  We  have many relationships with physical and metaphysical experience.  We define knowledge as subjective or objective.  And, we have evaluated our physical universe between the microscopic and macroscopic limits of observation.  


While the frontiers of the physical universe within those bounds continue to unfold to the grasp of our tools, we remain unsettled within the microcosm and macrocosms of our metaphysical universe.  We have yet to apply the principles developed over our millennia of development to the clarification of our knowledge of ourselves in the present tense, in situ.  


The metaphysical universe begins with the individual as a subjective being with body and mind.  The mind-body identity, or unity.  It extends into the past, present, and future of the perception of one or more individuals.  It includes the experience and development of the individual, and in particular the training and discipline through which we have developed the technologies we presently employ to communicate.
