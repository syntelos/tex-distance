My eyes look skyward in hope, through hair and cloud, over the rims of
my eyewear with the force of my heart.

This is my life, and it is your life, too.  My version is “in the
large”, and your version is “in the small”.  Or, as you call it,
“public life” and “private life”.

A distinction resting on the coin of success rather than the art of
being.  The time necessary to cross the river part art, part coin.  Of
body and mind, in a view of art not coin.  And in a coin, where art
meets mine.

And in this challenge not a knave?

Perhaps.  Of knives and tongues, to be sure.

It is art.  It expresses well.  A voice of truth and bearing.  What
would be art were it clear of infidelity.

That we carry others by our openness a certain fact.  The openness
that would be exploited by infidelity, so problematic as to consume a
year of life in the large, and entire lives in the small.
