     "Cosmic Love" written by Florence Leontine Mary Welch and

A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes.
I screamed aloud, as it tore through them.  And now it's left me blind.

The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out.
But you left me in the dark.

No dawn.  No day.  I'm always in this twilight.
In the shadows of your heart.

And you, in the dark, I can hear your heart beat.
I tried to find the sound.
But then it stopped, and I was in the darkness.
So darkness I became.

The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out.
You left me in the dark.
And no dawn, and no day, I'm always in this twilight,
In the shadow of your heart.

I took the stars from my eyes, and then I made a map,
and I knew that somehow I could find my way back.
Then I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too.
So I stayed in the darkness with you.

And the stars, the moon, they have all been blown out.
You left me in the dark.
And no dawn, and no day.  I'm always in this twilight.
In the shadow of your heart.

And the stars.  The moon.  They have all been blown out.
You left me in the dark.
And no dawn.  And no day.  I'm always in this twilight.
In the shadow of your heart.
