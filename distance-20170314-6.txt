Moisture on the windows is starting to freeze.  It feels hard and
ripply, and is still wet.  I can’t imagine that the windows won’t be
glazed in icy snow crystals by dawn.  Typically the low temperature of
the day is four A.M., and around here it drops precipitously during
the night.  An aggressive evening chill followed by a typical night
could spell, guessing, twenty degrees farenheit before dawn.
