A Peugeot carries itself around a bend of highway, lost in a sea of
distractions, its tires inflated, its paint painted, its driver and
its cat.  He slows the car, pulling it onto a concrete median, and
stops.  The door opens and the black feline descends.  It squats
beside the curb and pees.  It finishes and the driver scoops it up,
closes the door, and rests his foot beside the gas pedal.  A stack of
papers and things of his arm beside his hand, he imagines a friend.
