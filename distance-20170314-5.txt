The snow accumulated, sublimated, and the temperature dropped with the
sun to the horizon.  Poetic, but cold.  These thermal bags that I live
in have been cooling off as the body has been lowering its heat
output.  Not ideal.  I wrap them over head until a vent forms, invaded
by grey hair.  The western horizon darkens.
